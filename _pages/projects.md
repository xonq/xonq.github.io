<b>CLOCI:</b> I am the sole developer of the most comprehensive gene cluster
prediction algorithm with the highest quality gene cluster reports to date. CLOCI performs
the best in recovering reference biosynthetic gene clusters, with a 20%
improvement compared to antiSMASH. CLOCI unveils previously undetectable
clusters that produce drugs, such as the psilocybin synthesis cluster.
Additionally, CLOCI reports clusters with 0 median extraneous and missing
genes, leading to higher quality heterologous expression predictions - in
comparison, antiSMASH on average predicts clusters double their size, leading
to failed heterologous expression.
