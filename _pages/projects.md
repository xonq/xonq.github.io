<b>CLOCI:</b> CLOCI is the most comprehensive prediction algorithm for gene
clusters that produce drug leads with the highest quality gene cluster reports to date. CLOCI performs
the best in recovering reference biosynthetic gene clusters, with a 20%
improvement compared to the leading standard, antiSMASH. CLOCI unveils previously undetectable
clusters that produce drugs, such as the psilocybin synthesis cluster.
Additionally, CLOCI reports clusters with 0 median extraneous and missing
genes, leading to higher quality heterologous expression predictions - in
comparison, antiSMASH on average predicts clusters double their size, leading
to failed heterologous expression.

<b>Mycotools</b>: Mycotools is the foundation for automating genomics research.
Mycotools increases the scale of all genomics data by
automatically assimilating a local database
of publicly- and locally-available genomes. This approach standardizes 
genomics by curating notoriously inconsistent formats, 
and streamlines collaboration by implementing a singular, easily-disseminated
file format. Mycotools software suite includes modules for automating
routine-complex comparative genomics, which form the basis for phylogenomic and
gene cluster evolutionary analysis pipelines.
