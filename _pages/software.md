CLOCI aids genome-guided drug discovery by accurately detecting 
colocalized, coordinately functioning genes, or gene clusters, 
that underly the synthesis of microbial natural products. CLOCI
enables efficient detection to heterologous expression 
of pathways of interest, benchmarking at <a
href="https://github.com/xonq/cloci/blob/master/etc/boundaries.png">0 median extraneous and missing
genes</a> per reference cluster. CLOCI
recovers reference biosynthetic gene clusters with a <a
href="https://github.com/xonq/cloci/blob/master/etc/recovery.png">15%
improvement compared to the leading standard, antiSMASH</a>. The CLOCI approach is
suited for identifying drug lead-producing gene clusters that were previously overlooked, 
such as the neuroactive psilocybin synthesis cluster. <a

Mycotools is a foundation for automating genomics research.
Mycotools software suite includes 
modules for automating routine-complex comparative genomics. Mycotools is currently optimized for fungi, though prokaryotes are compatible and the framework is taxonomy-agnostic. <a
