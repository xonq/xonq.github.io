I provide consultation through Mycomics, LLC: computational work, 
technical consultation, computational infrastructure development/deployment,
mycology/fungal biology education/outreach, software workshops, among other
skills relevant to my expertise.

My first 30 minute consultation is free and I am happy to meet for discussing 
potential contracts. My rates vary depending on the duration of the contract, 
monthly commitment, and potential for ongoing collaboration. I have reduced rates 
for mycology education.

Please email konkelzach@pm.me for more information, meeting, and contracting.
