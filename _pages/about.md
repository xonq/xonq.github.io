I am a computational biologist, genome scientist, mycologist, and analytical chemist. I develop, implement, and consult on cutting-edge genomics software and database deployment that enables large-scale, high throughput comparative analyses. I am particularly specialized in genomic-guided drug discovery, phylogenomics, and general integrative-omic analysis.

I am currently finalizing my PhD with Dr. [Jason C. Slot](https://u.osu.edu/slot.1/) at The Ohio State University, where I am a Translational Plant Sciences Fellow, Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center Associate, and University Fellow. I previously worked as a quality control chemist, implementing chromatography and mass spectrometry to analyze terpenoid, pesticide, and solvent residues. I was trained in mass spectrometry and chromatography in Dr. [Sandra Loesgen's](http://loesgenlab.org/index.html) lab for four years.
