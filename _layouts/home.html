I have 10 years of experience across the continuum of metabologenomic-driven
drug discovery and large-scale genomics analysis and automation. My time in
analytical chemistry and genome biology research cultivated a skillset that spans applied evolutionary theory, genome science,
fungal biology, bioinformatics, and analytical chemistry. Examples of the
applied contributions of my work include:
<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2214076120">identifying
industrially-important flavor genes in shiitake mushrooms</a> by integrating transcriptomic 
and phylogenomic data; <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.14.532605v1.full">pinpointing clusters of colocalized genes that produce analogs of the psychoactive drug, LSD</a>; and developing a <a
href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.20.545441v1">genome-driven
natural product biosynthesis targeting platform</a> that greatly exceeds
current published standards. Throughout my time in drug discovery, I have
become familiar of the challenges of the old "needle in the haystack" approach of
redundantly investigating lineages for novel compounds, and am inspired to
further my work to increase the throughput of identifying new compounds; deconvolute gene cluster heterologous expression; and
bring cryptic lineages with high potential for novel discovery into the
fold. I am open to employment, contracting, and
consultation - please follow and contact me.

I received my PhD in Dr. <a
href="http://u.osu.edu/slot.1">Jason Slot's</a> lab at The Ohio State University
as a Translational Plant Sciences Fellow, Ohio Agricultural Research
and Development Center Associate, and University Fellow. Prior to my PhD, I worked in
industry as a quality control chemist, implementing chromatography and mass
spectrometry to quantify terpenoid, pesticide, and residual solvent
concentrations. I was
trained in mass spectrometry and chromatography as a natural product drug
discovery chemist in Dr. <a href="http://loesgenlab.org/index.html">Sandra Loesgen's</a> lab for four years.
