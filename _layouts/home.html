<b>I am a highly collaborative computational biologist passionate about developing
the next generation of microbial bioinformatics.</b> I currently collaborate with
developers, analysts, and public health lab partners at
<a href="https://www.theiagen.com">Theiagen genomics</a> to enable cloud-based next generation public health
genomics. Some focal projects include facilitating <i>Candidozyma auris</i> epidemiological analysis, while developing 
software for viral genomic characterization. Beyond the computer, I strive
to educate communities on fungal biology, which includes invited teaching and
<a href="https://youtu.be/5FVbRDy-nBU?si=NUouztIDBSnR9nf8&t=3143s">workshop
presentations</a> for technical expertise and general
botany/mycology education. Please, view my <a
href="https://github.com/xonq">GitHub</a> portfolio, and reach out to discuss all things microbial
genomics and mycology education.


<br><br>

My career includes both industry and academic experience, with 5 years in
natural product drug discovery analytical chemistry, followed by 7 years in
computational genomics. My background has a strong focus
on phylogenomics, general NGS data analysis (genomics/transcriptomics), collaborative software development, 
and hands-on mass spectrometry method development (LCMS/MS, GCMS/MS).
