I am a computational biologist focused on genome science with 10 years
experience across chemistry and bioinformatics disciplines. I specialize in discovering and optimizing genetic pathways
underlying biological traits-of-interest. To this end, I employ a variety of
tailored multi-omic analyses that include general next-generation sequencing
(NGS) analysis, mass spectrometry, phylogenomics, RNAseq, and genomic discovery. My experience has been applied to eukaryotes
(fungi and plants) as well as prokaryotes, and includes invited teaching and
<a href="https://youtu.be/5FVbRDy-nBU?si=NUouztIDBSnR9nf8&t=3143s">workshop
presentations</a> for technical expertise and general
botany/mycology education.

My career includes both industry and academic experience, with 5 years in natural product drug discovery analytical chemistry, followed by 5 years in
computational genomics focusing on 
identifying underlying genes and optimizing/engineering expression of phenotypes-of-interest. I currently work as a
post-doctoral researcher and industry scientific consultant focused on plant
pathogenic bacteria and cryptic fungal biosynthetic pathways. My
PhD in <a href="http://u.osu.edu/slot.1">Jason Slot's</a> lab culminated in 
1) an evolution-informed natural product biosynthesis targeting platform that <a
href="https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkae625">can recover
biosynthetic pathways with increased accuracy and recovery compared to published 
standards in the field</a>; and 2) a platform for <a
href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.08.556886v1">automating
large-scale comparative phylogenomics</a>. I am driven to address
applied questions in industry, where I have 
helped <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2214076120">identify
flavor gene candidates in shiitake mushrooms</a> by integrating transcriptomic 
and phylogenomic data. I employed another tailored genome-guided strategy to <a
href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0289280">pinpoint
clusters of colocalized genes that produce analogs of the psychoactive drug,
LSD</a>.
