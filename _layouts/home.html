I am a computational biologist, genome scientist, mycologist, and analytical
chemist. I
am particularly specialized in large-scale genomics automation in the context of metabologenomic drug discovery.The software I have developed automates large-scale phylogenomics to present insight into applied systems, such as: identifying industrially-important flavor genes in shiitake mushrooms; pinpointing bioactive gene clusters that produce precursor analogs of the psychoactive drug, LSD; and implementing an evolution-based gene cluster detection algorithm that outperforms current standards. My expertise at the interface of these disciplines can add value to your team by presenting insight into your system and automating routine-complex multi-omic analysis.

I am currently finalizing my PhD with Dr. <a
href="http://u.osu.edu/slot.1">Jason Slot</a> at The Ohio State University,
where I am a Translational Plant Sciences Fellow, Ohio Agricultural Research
and Development Center Associate, and University Fellow. I previously worked in
industry as a quality control chemist, implementing chromatography and mass
spectrometry to quantify terpenoid, pesticide, and residual solvent
concentrations. I was
trained in mass spectrometry and chromatography as a natural product drug
discovery chemist in Dr. <a href="http://loesgenlab.org/index.html">Sandra Loesgen's</a> lab for four years.
