I am a computational biologist, genome scientist, mycologist, and analytical
chemist. I
specialize in large-scale genomics analysis and automation in the context of
metabologenomic drug discovery, though my expertise is generally applicable to
multiomic analysis. I have deployed the automation software I developed to present insight into
applied systems, such as: <a
href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2214076120">identifying
industrially-important flavor genes in shiitake mushrooms</a> by synthesizing
transcriptomic and phylogenomic analysis; <a
href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.14.532605v1.full">pinpointing
bioactive gene clusters that produce analogs of the psychoactive drug, LSD</a>;
and <a
href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.20.545441v1">engineering
a generalized gene cluster detection framework</a> that identifies natural
product-yielding gene clusters with unprecendented recovery and and output
quality. My expertise across computer science, evolutionary theory, and
analytical chemistry uniquely positions me to present insight into diverse
systems and automate routine-complex multi-omic analysis.

I am currently finalizing my PhD with Dr. <a
href="http://u.osu.edu/slot.1">Jason Slot</a> at The Ohio State University
(August 11<sup>th</sup>),
where I am a Translational Plant Sciences Fellow, Ohio Agricultural Research
and Development Center Associate, and University Fellow. I previously worked in
industry as a quality control chemist, implementing chromatography and mass
spectrometry to quantify terpenoid, pesticide, and residual solvent
concentrations. I was
trained in mass spectrometry and chromatography as a natural product drug
discovery chemist in Dr. <a href="http://loesgenlab.org/index.html">Sandra Loesgen's</a> lab for four years.
