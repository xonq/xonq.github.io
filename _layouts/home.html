I specialize in discovering genes that underlie traits-of-interest
by intergrating genomics with other -omic data. My overall expertise is 
in mass spectrometry, evolutionary biology, molecular ecology, and multi-omic analysis.
I provide consultation in bioinformatics/computational biology and mycology
(fungal/mushroom) education.

<br><br>

My training includes 5 years in natural product drug discovery and quality control 
analytical chemistry (industry and academic), followed by 5 years in
computational genomics focusing on 
detection and evolution of fungal small molecule biosynthesis. My
work in <a href="http://u.osu.edu/slot.1">Jason Slot's</a> lab culminated in 
1) an evolution-informed natural product biosynthesis targeting platform that <a
href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.20.545441v1">can recover
biosynthetic pathways with increased accuracy and recovery compared to published 
standards in the field</a>; and 2) a platform for <a
href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.08.556886v1">automating
large-scale comparative phylogenomics</a>. I am driven to address
applied questions in industry, where I have 
helped <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2214076120">identify
flavor gene candidates in shiitake mushrooms</a> by integrating transcriptomic 
and phylogenomic data. I employed another tailored genome-guided strategy to <a
href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.14.532605v1.full">pinpoint
clusters of colocalized genes that produce analogs of the psychoactive drug,
LSD</a>.

<br><br>

I received my PhD in Dr. <a
href="http://u.osu.edu/slot.1">Jason Slot's</a> lab at The Ohio State University
as an Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center Associate. Prior to my PhD, I worked in
industry as a quality control chemist, implementing chromatography and mass
spectrometry. I was trained in mass spectrometry and chromatography as a natural product drug
discovery chemist in Dr. <a href="http://loesgenlab.org/index.html">Sandra Loesgen's</a> lab for four years.
