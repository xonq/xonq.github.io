I am a versatile computational biologist, genome scientist, mycologist, and analytical
chemist. My focus lies in large-scale genomics analysis and automation,
specificially within the field of metabologenomic-driven drug discovery. I
possess a broad skillset that is generally applicable to multiomic analysis. 
I have successfully implemented this knowledge-base in automation software that has provided valuable
insights into multiple applied systems. For instance, I have integrated
transcriptomic and phylogenomic analysis to <a
href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2214076120">identify
industrially-important flavor genes in shiitake mushrooms</a>. Additionally, I <a
href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.14.532605v1.full">pinpointed
clusters of colocalized genes that produce analogs of the psychoactive drug,
LSD</a>. I scaled this approach by <a
href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.20.545441v1">generalizing
gene cluster detection</a> to elucidate the
genetic underpinnings of microbial natural product synthesis with unprecendented recovery and output
quality. My expertise across these disciplines uniquely qualifies me to provide
valuable insights into diverse
systems and automate complex multiomic analysis.

I am currently finalizing my PhD with Dr. <a
href="http://u.osu.edu/slot.1">Jason Slot</a> at The Ohio State University
(August 11<sup>th</sup>),
where I am a Translational Plant Sciences Fellow, Ohio Agricultural Research
and Development Center Associate, and University Fellow. I previously worked in
industry as a quality control chemist, implementing chromatography and mass
spectrometry to quantify terpenoid, pesticide, and residual solvent
concentrations. I was
trained in mass spectrometry and chromatography as a natural product drug
discovery chemist in Dr. <a href="http://loesgenlab.org/index.html">Sandra Loesgen's</a> lab for four years.
