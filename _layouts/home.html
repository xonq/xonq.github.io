I am a computational genomics contractor and consultant. 
My expertise spans a spectrum across computational biology, genomics, fungal biology, and analytical
chemistry. My focus lies in large-scale genomics analysis and automation,
specificially within the field of metabologenomic-driven drug discovery. I
possess a broad skillset that is generally applicable to multiomic analysis and has provided valuable
insights into multiple applied systems. Examples of my contributions include:
<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2214076120">identifying
industrially-important flavor genes in shiitake mushrooms</a> by integrating transcriptomic 
and phylogenomic data; <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.14.532605v1.full">pinpointing clusters of colocalized genes that produce analogs of the psychoactive drug, LSD</a>; and developing a <a
href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.20.545441v1">bleeding-edge genomic-driven natural product biosynthesis targeting platform</a> that greatly exceeds current industry standards. My expertise across these disciplines uniquely qualifies me to provide valuable insight in genomic-driven drug discovery research and computational biology in general.

I received my PhD in Dr. <a
href="http://u.osu.edu/slot.1">Jason Slot's</a> lab at The Ohio State University
as a Translational Plant Sciences Fellow, Ohio Agricultural Research
and Development Center Associate, and University Fellow. Prior to my PhD, I worked in
industry as a quality control chemist, implementing chromatography and mass
spectrometry to quantify terpenoid, pesticide, and residual solvent
concentrations. I was
trained in mass spectrometry and chromatography as a natural product drug
discovery chemist in Dr. <a href="http://loesgenlab.org/index.html">Sandra Loesgen's</a> lab for four years.
