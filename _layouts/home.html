<b>I am passionate about collaborative computational biology and education
projects by contributing with my extensive problem-solving, mycology/general
microbial genomics, and
natural products expertise.</b> My current primary focus is collaborating with developers, analysts, and state public health labs at
<a href="https://www.theiagen.com">Theiagen Genomics</a> to enable accessible,
cloud-based public health
genomics. Beyond the computer, I strive
to educate communities on fungal biology, which includes invited teaching and
<a href="https://youtu.be/5FVbRDy-nBU?si=NUouztIDBSnR9nf8&t=3143s">workshop
presentations</a> for technical expertise and general
botany/mycology education. Please, view my <a
href="https://github.com/xonq">GitHub</a> portfolio, and reach out to discuss all things microbial
genomics and mycology education. (Ask me about bouldering and music!)


<br><br>

My career includes 5 years in
fungal natural product drug discovery analytical chemistry, 1 year in quality
control chemistry, followed by 7 years in
computational genomics (fungi, plants, prokaryotes, and viruses). My background has a strong focus
on phylogenomics, general NGS data analysis (genomics/transcriptomics), collaborative software development, 
and hands-on mass spectrometry method development (LCMS/MS, GCMS/MS).
